                      You may know him. The Rock. His whole life is a pure
                      motivation. He came from the very bottom. He once said
                      there was a time where he had 7 bucks in his pocket. Today
                      he is the highest-grossing actor. Or at least one of them.
                      His body, his mind, his whole personality is trained to
                      the fullest! Go and watch this video where he talks about
                      motivation and his story and then go and chase your
                      dreams!
