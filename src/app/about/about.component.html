        <p>
          Im just like you. Well, at least i think so. I work everyday in a nine
          to five job. On top of that i need round about 2,5 hours to get to my
          job and back home.
        </p>
        <strong>Everyday.</strong> <br />
        <p>
          This is so much time. And within this time you dont work for yourself.
          You have a boss who is chasing his dreams. And when you come back home
          you are stressed and tired and just want to relax.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have reached the point where a voice in my head said to me: No, this
          is not enough for me. I will chase my own dreams!
        </p>

        <h3 class="title-uppercase">
          This is the birth of Dreamtracker!
        </h3>
        <p>
          Now im chasing my dreams. After my day job i work hard for my goals
          even if its only 5 minutes. Every minute is important. I started to
          write my dreams down and divided it into multiple goals. You need to
          write your dreams down to make them more real. You need to see them.
          Make yourself a list of goals. Each goal is one step closer to make
          your dream come true! Dreamtracker will help you with chasing your
          dreams.
