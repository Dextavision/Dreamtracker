                    <h5 class="description">Im just like you. Well, at least i think so. I work everyday in a nine to five job. On top of that
                        i need round about 2,5 hours to get to my job and back home. Everyday. This is so much time. And within this time you dont work for 
                        yourself. You have a boss who is chasing his dreams. And when you come back home you are stressed and tired and just want to relax.
                        I have reached the point where a voice in my head said to me: No, this is not enough for me. I want more for myself!<br>
                        <h2 class="title">This is the birth of Dreamtracker!</h2><br>
                        Now im chasing my dreams. After work i work hard for my goals even if its only 5 minutes. Every minute is important. I started
                        to write my dreams down and divided it into multiple goals. You need to bring your goals to paper, or in my case to the E-Paper. You need
                        to see them. Make yourself a to-do list and start working on this every single day.
                        Dreamtracker will help you with chasing your dreams.<br><br>
