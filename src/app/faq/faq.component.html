        </h3>
        <p>
          I would highly appreciate it!
          <br />
          I built this platform for you and i want you to be part of it and also
          develop it with me.<br />
          I work completely alone on it in my free time so if you find a bug
          please contact me so i can make Dreamtracker better for us. And if you
          have an idea for a new feature you can also contact me. I would love
          to hear any feedback from you.
          <br />
          You can contact me at <b>dreamchaser@dreamtrackerapp.com</b>

          How many people are behind Dreamtracker?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Its just one person. I created it and i hope many people can make use
          of it and chasing their dreams!
        </p>

        <h3 class="title-uppercase">
          Is Dreamtracker for free?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Short Answer: Yes!
          <br />
          Maybe in the future there will be a PRO upgrade with a set of features
          but the base usage of Dreamtracker will be free forever! I want that
          anybody that have an internet connection can make use of it regardless
          of their current situation.
